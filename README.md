### Tips for Your README

✔ A good README is like a **project’s story** — include what it does, why it matters, how to run it, and links to demos or screenshots. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
✔ You can add badges (GitHub stats, languages, etc.) to make it more engaging. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
✔ Show live links to your portfolio site (GitHub Pages or Vercel) so recruiters can click directly. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
